				<p class="pb-3">Total hip replacement   most commonly used to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis. Other indications include rheumatoid arthritis, certain hip fractures, and benign and malignant bone tumors. The aim of the procedure is pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as physical therapy and pain medications, have failed.</p>
				<p>In a total hip replacement (also called total hip arthroplasty), the damaged bone and cartilage of hip joint is removed and replaced with prosthetic components. Hip replacement surgery is one of the most successful operations in all of medicine.</p>

                           <h3 class="pb-2 f600">1) Why should someone need Total hip replacement?</h3>
                           <p class="pb-4">Total hip replacement is often necessary after the cartilage between the femoral head and acetabulum wears out. Arthritis leaves patients with severe pain and immobility. Typically, a hip replacement is not performed unless non surgical methods fail to relieve hip pain.</p>
                           
                           <h3 class="pb-2 f600">2) Will I be pain free after my surgery?</h3>
                           <p class="pb-4">Most Hip replacement patients report being completely pain free after 3-4weeks.</p>
                           
                           <h3 class="pb-2 f600">3) How long will I have to stay in the medical facility?</h3>
                           <p class="pb-4">Patients who have their surgery done in the hospital typically stay for about 3-4 days.</p>
                           
                           <h3 class="pb-2 f600">4) How long will I have to take off from work?</h3>
                           <p class="pb-4"> It is recommended that patients take 4-6 weeks off to work depending on their occupation. Patients who have a desk job go back to work sooner than patients who have manual labour jobs or have to be on their feet long.</p>
                           
                           <h3 class="pb-2 f600">5) Will I need physical therapy?</h3>
                           <p class="pb-4">Yes. Physical therapy is an essential part of your Total hip replacement recovery process. Physical therapy begins the day of your surgery and will continue for 4-6 weeks.</p>
                           
                           <h3 class="pb-2 f600">6) How long before I can drive after surgery?</h3>
                           <p class="pb-4">One can drive comfortably 6-8 weeks after surgery.</p>
